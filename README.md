###What is Park-N-Go?###
Park-N-Go is a mobile app that allows a user to pin their location and from there, the user may search 
for popular locations and create routes to get to their destination. Park-N-Go has Yelp's API integrated
within it to ensure quality of destinations can be viewed.

#Getting Started#

   wherever your last pin was and keep track of it and your current location.
* If you want to pin a new location, simply hit the trashcan symbol on the top left corner and then hit the
   "Pin My Location".
* The "Pinned Location" tab will have the address of your current location and local venues nearby (such as
   gas stations, restaurants, etc.)
* The "Attractions" tab will let you choose an attraction and the genres to it. For example, food will have
   multiple categories such burger joints or seafood restaurants.
